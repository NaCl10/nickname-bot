# Nickname bot

## WARNING: THIS BOT IS HORRIBLY INSECURE AND SHOULD ABSOLUTELY **NOT** BE USED EXCEPT IN PRIVATE SERVERS ("just for friends" type situations)

It has **NO** restrictions on who can and can't change whose nickname(s), and there's **NO WAY** to add that functionality (unless you want to fork the project and add it yourself).  
Technically you could restrict who can change whose nickname by placing the bot's role above roles with users you want users to be able to change the nicknames of, but below roles with users you don't want users to be able to change the nicknames of, but that's rather crude.  
I suppose you may use it if you really want to. Here's the link to [add it to your server](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=813147271160004629&permissions=201411584&scope=bot).  
Please ensure you place the bot's role at the top of the role list OR above all of the roles that you want users to be able to change the name of. If a user has ANY role that is ANYWHERE above the bot's role, their name will not be change-able with the bot's command.
