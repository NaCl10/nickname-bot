# Nickname bot

## WARNING: THIS BOT IS HORRIBLY INSECURE AND SHOULD ABSOLUTELY **NOT** BE USED EXCEPT IN PRIVATE SERVERS ("just for friends" type situations)

It has **NO** restrictions on who can and can't change whose nickname(s), and there's **NO WAY** to add that functionality (unless you want to fork the project and add it yourself).  
I suppose you may use it if you really want to. Here's the link to [add it to your server](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=813147271160004629&permissions=201411584&scope=bot).
